## FOR DATA, WE WILL USE (INITIALLY):

### Weight/Height/BMI

- This is pretty straightforward, I believe it's better to take both weight and height and calculate the BMI because we might have to use the patient's weight in some formulas, like renal function.

### Blood Pressure

- Blood pressure is also straightforward, only issue is that we do have both systolic and diastolic BP so we'll have to see if we have to separate them or if we can use them together. Reference levels varies by some conditions.

### Glucose

- Blood sugar. This is important in mostly diabetics, but also plays a vital role in other conditions like obesity, HBP (High Blood Pressure) and also some metabolic diseases. Reference levels do not vary that much.

### Cholesterol

- Cholesterol is a major cause of vascular and heart disease, but the issue is that is divided in three components (there are more but they mostly don't matter): LDL (bad cholestol), HDL (good cholesterol), Triglycerides, so we'll have to figure out how to separate them. Reference levels are not that complicated either.

### Creatinine

- This is a marker for kidney function. Basically, if it's high, your kidneys are screwed. By itself it might not be a fantastic marker but we can use it on something called Cockcroft-Gault Equation to estimate the renal function (I can do that on the backend). Reference levels are mostly solid.

### Na, K

- Sodium and potassium, pretty straightforward. Some medications can interfere with the levels so it's usually part of the lab work. Reference levels are solid.

### Proteinuria

- Amount of protein that is passed in urine. Normally there would be only a tiny amount passed by urine, but on some conditions this can rise and it predicts renal failure in some patients. Values and references are pretty straightforward.

### Hemoglobin

- Pretty much the most useful information on that huge blood count, it says if you have anemia or not. Some diseases can cause anemia so it's important. Reference levels varies by sex.

### HbA1C

- This predicts basically the average glucose level in patients for the last 2-3 months. This is a very important test in diabetic patients. Reference levels are mostly solid but can vary by strictness of treatment.
